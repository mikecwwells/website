	<h1><font color="green"><u>About me</u></font></h1>
	<br>
	<p>I'm Mike Wells, and I'm a student in Richmond, Virginia, USA, studying Information Systems at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm a senior, hoping to graduate at the end of 2022.</p>
	<p>I grew up in Williamsburg, Virginia, and loved to take electronics apart as a kid. They never went back together after I finished with them, though.</p>
	<br>
	<p>With a passion for both circuits and service, I have experience in a variety of both technology-focused and customer-facing positions such as IT support, device deployment logistics, and even customer service.</p>
	<p>I'm currently a technician on the in-house IT team at Integrated Global Services, a premier global provider of industrial thermal solutions, supporting our users' hardware and software needs  and assisting with company-wide technology projects to bring our technological assets to the next level.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I value providing the friendliest and most approachable IT support to our help desk users. At the end of the day, no matter how many tickets we close, it's user satisfaction that truly matters the most.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As an amateur sysadmin, I run my own email, CalDAV+CardDAV, and web servers. I use Mail-in-a-Box, Radicale, and Cherokee respectively.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I'm interested in pens and stationery, casual gaming, and analog photography.</p>
